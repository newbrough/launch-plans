Zookeeper Cloudinitd level
==========================

The plan is set up to run a standard three node zookeeper deployment. If you
would like to run a single node deployment, you will need to make the following
changes:

1. Open zookeeper.conf, and remove or comment out the replica_count line.
2. If you would like zookeeper to run on the basenode, uncomment the hostname
line
3. Open deps.conf, and uncomment the zookeeperX line that matches your
deployment. There are options for deploying on the basenode, a single node, or
three nodes.
4. Open zookeeper.json, and change the servers line to match what you set up in
deps.conf
